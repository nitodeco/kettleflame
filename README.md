# Virety - (Vi)te + (Re)act + (Ty)pescript

Just some boilerplate React+Vite+Typescript that I use for my projects. Feel free to use according to the [License](#License)

## Usage

1. **Clone repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nitodeco/virety
```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   - Once the cloning process is complete, navigate to the directory of the cloned project using the `cd` command. For example:
     ```
     cd example-project
     ```

3. **Install Node.js Dependencies:**

   - Inside the project directory, there should be a `package.json` file which lists all the Node.js dependencies required for the project.
   - Run the following command to install these dependencies using npm:
     ```
     npm install
     ```
   - This command will download and install all the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

4. **Verify Installation:**

   - After the installation process completes, you can verify that all dependencies were installed successfully by checking for any error messages in the terminal.
   - Additionally, you can also check the `node_modules` directory within the project to ensure that all dependencies were downloaded.

5. **Start Using the Project:**
   - Once all dependencies are installed successfully, you can start using the project according to its documentation or instructions provided by the project maintainers.
